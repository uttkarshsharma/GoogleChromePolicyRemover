# GoogleChromePolicyRemover
This batch script is designed to remove Google Chrome policies that may be managed by Group Policy in Windows. These policies are often used by organizations to enforce certain settings in Chrome, and removing them can help reset Chrome to its default state on systems where such policies are no longer required or were accidentally applied.
